      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;international-non-governmental-organizations-ingos&#34;&gt;International non-governmental organizations (INGOs)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;International non-governmental organizations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://camgdp.org/category/ingo/&#34;&gt;INGOs&lt;/a&gt;) typically bring a global and comparative perpective to the data and information they collect, often providing standardized reporting across countries.  INGOs can be good sources of numeric data at the country-level but may be lacking in local points of view and distinctive local voices and detail (such as provincial or city level data).  Other INGOs take a more focused and activist perspective on specific issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to  Uzbekistanâ€™s Gender Data Research Guide, a resource designed to illuminate the multifaceted dimensions of this crucial topic within the unique cultural and historical context of Uzbekistan. As a nation embedded in the heart of Central Asia, Uzbekistan has a rich tapestry of traditions, customs, and sociopolitical influences that have shaped the experiences of its people in relation to gender and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This guide has been carefully curated to serve as a valuable tool for scholars, students, researchers, activists, and anyone keen to explore the intricate dynamics of gender and sexuality within Uzbekistan. We hope to enable users of this guide to develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how these constructs are created, perceived, and navigated in this diverse and rapidly evolving society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
